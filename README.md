# Blanket Stuff

This is (or will be) planning tool for creating a temperature blanket using crochet granny squares. The idea is that there are three concentric circles each depicting data: the min temp, max temp, and avg temp of a day during the course of a year.

## To Do

- [x] Figure out a specific i value, such as for a birthday
- [x] Add border to circles
- [x] Reduce radiuses so the borders don't overlap
- [ ] Sampling yarn colors

Add inputs/interactions for:

- [ ] year
- [ ] location
- [ ] month/legend toggle
- [ ] resizing tool
- [ ] colorpicker for buckets?

Cities to pull data from:

- [ ] Sacramento (2006)
- [ ] Belize
- [ ] Costa Rica
- [ ] Hoboken, NJ
- [ ] Baton Rouge, Louisiana
